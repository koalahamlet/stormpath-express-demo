Example user authentication app using stormpath.

To start, cd into the project directory and run
$npm start
this will start the app listening on localhost:3000

You will be taken to a page to register a user account that will ask for an email and password.

After that, you will be logged in with that account. You may logout and login again with the credentials you initially used.

And presto, you've got the skeleton of an authenticated login as long as you want stormpath managing that for you.
